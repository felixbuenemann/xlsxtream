# Xlsxtream

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xlsxtream.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/xlsxtream)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream)

Xlsxtream is a streaming writer for XLSX spreadsheets. It supports multiple worksheets and optional string
deduplication via a shared string table (SST). Its purpose is to replace CSV for large exports, because using
CSV in Excel is very buggy and error prone. It's very efficient and can quickly write millions of rows with
low memory usage.

Xlsxtream does not support formatting, charts, comments and a myriad of
other [OOXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) features. If you are looking for a
fully featured solution take a look at [axslx](https://github.com/randym/axlsx).

Xlsxtream supports writing to files or IO-like objects, data is flushed as the ZIP compressor sees fit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xlsxtream'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xlsxtream

## Usage

```ruby
# Creates a new workbook and closes it at the end of the block
Xlsxtream::Workbook.open('my_data.xlsx') do |xlsx|
  xlsx.write_worksheet 'Sheet1' do |sheet|
    # Boolean, Date, Time, DateTime and Numeric are properly mapped
    sheet << [true, Date.today, 'hello', 'world', 42, 3.14159265359, 42**13]
  end
end

io = StringIO.new
xlsx = Xlsxtream::Workbook.new(io)

# Number of columns doesn't have to match
xlsx.write_worksheet 'Sheet1' do |sheet|
  sheet << ['first', 'row']
  sheet << ['second', 'row', 'with', 'more colums']
end

# Write multiple worksheets with custom names
xlsx.write_worksheet 'AppendixSheet' do |sheet|
  sheet.add_row ['Timestamp', 'Comment']
  sheet.add_row [Time.now, 'Good times']
  sheet.add_row [Time.now, 'Time-machine']
end

# If you have highly repetitive data, you can enable Shared String Tables (SST)
# for the workbook or a single worksheet. The SST has to be kept in memory,
# so do not use it if you have a huge amount of rows or a little duplication
# of content across cells. A single SST is used for the whole workbook.
xlsx.write_worksheet('SheetWithSST', :use_shared_strings => true) do |sheet|
  sheet << ['the', 'same', 'old', 'story']
  sheet << ['the', 'old', 'same', 'story']
  sheet << ['old', 'the', 'same', 'story']
end

# Strings in numeric or date/time format can be auto-detected and formatted
# appropriately. This is a convenient way to avoid an Excel-warning about
# "Number stored as text". Dates and times must be in the ISO-8601 format and
# numeric values must contain only numbers and an optional decimal separator.
# The strings true and false are detected as boolean values.
xlsx.write_worksheet('SheetWithAutoFormat', :auto_format => true) do |sheet|
  # these two rows will be identical in the xlsx-output
  sheet << [true, 11.85, DateTime.parse('2050-01-01T12:00'), Date.parse('1984-01-01')]
  sheet << ['true', '11.85', '2050-01-01T12:00', '1984-01-01']
end

# Writes metadata and ZIP archive central directory
xlsx.close
# Close IO object
io.close
```

## Development
